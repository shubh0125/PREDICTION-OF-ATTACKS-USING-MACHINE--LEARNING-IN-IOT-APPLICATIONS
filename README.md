# Attack-Detection-in-IoT-Using-Machine-Learning-Approaches
IoT models are becoming more advanced as demand and growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) 
automated network system grows. People are becoming accustomed to data-driven infrastructure, 
and this is leading the research more on Machine Learning based applications alongside IoT. 
Human Life, at present, uses IoT and Machine Learning techniques everywhere. In medicine 
interpretation of ECG, pattern finding in genomic data, brain signal modelling all these complex 
tasks require the introduction of machine learning approaches. IoT devices use a wireless 
channel to transmit data which makes them a vulnerable target. A typical communication attack 
on a local network is restricted to local nodes or small local domains, however an attack on an 
IoT system spans a larger geographic area and has major repercussions on the IoT sites. The 
primary goal of our system is to develop a smart, secured and reliable IoT based infrastructure 
that can detect its vulnerability along with having a secure firewall against all cyber-attacks 
which allows it to recover itself automatically. Here, a Machine Learning based solution will be 
proposed which can detect and protect the system when it is in an abnormal state.
